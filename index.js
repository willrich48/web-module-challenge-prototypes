/* ❗❗ NOTE: PLEASE USE INDIVIDUAL KEYS FOR YOUR CONSTRUCTOR PARAMETERS, NOT OBJECTS. THE TESTS WILL NOT PASS WITH OBJECTS. ❗❗  */

/*
  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + .eat() should recieve a string as a parameter and take some type of edible as an argument
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach` array.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` array should be empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"
*/

function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.stomach = [];

}
Person.prototype.eat = function (edible) {
  if(this.stomach.length < 10) {
    this.stomach.push(edible);
  }
}
Person.prototype.poop = function () {
  this.stomach = [];
}
Person.prototype.toString = function () {
  return `${this.name}, ${this.age}`
}


/*
  TASK 2
    - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.
    - All instances built with Car:
        + should initialize with an `tank` at 0
        + should initialize with an `odometer` at 0
    - Give cars the ability to get fueled with a `.fill(gallons)` method
      + should take 'gallons' as an parameter which will take number of gallons as an argument
      + should add the gallons to `tank`.
    - STRETCH: Give cars ability to `.drive(distance)`. The distance driven:
        + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
        + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
        + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.
*/

function Car(model, milesPerGallon) {
  this.model = model;
  this.milesPerGallon = milesPerGallon;
  this.tank = 0;
  this.odometer = 0;

}
Car.prototype.fill = function (gallons) {
  this.tank = this.tank + gallons;
}


/*
  TASK 3
    - Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person.
    - Besides `name` and `age`, Baby takes a third argument to initialize `favoriteToy`.
    - Besides the methods on Person.prototype, babies also have the ability to `.play()`:
        + Should return a string "Playing with x", x being the favorite toy.
*/

function Baby(name, age, favoriteToy) {
  Person.call(this, name, age);
  this.favoriteToy = favoriteToy;
}
Baby.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
Baby.prototype.play = function(){
  return `Playing with ${this.favoriteToy}`;
}

/* 
  TASK 4
  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. window binding - the context of "this" is the global object, when you see this in the wild, usually it means someone made an error
  2. implicit binding - dot syntax, where the left side of the dot is an object and the right side of the dot is a key name, the left side of the dot is "this"
  3. explicit binding -  using JS methods to bind properties/values to a given "this" object/context, .call(): gives the context of an obj to the function you're invoking upon
  4. new binding - most common outside dot syntax/implicit binding, helps the compiler to know that you're creating an instance of a prototype or class
